           Abstract
        </h3>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilades_pandava">Chilades pandava </a>(Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) larval food quality was studied to determine its influence on adult life history traits. A wild population from Cycas nongnoochiae (Cycadales: Cycadaceae) endemic habitat behaved similarly to the population collected from a garden setting. Cycas micronesica, Cycas revoluta, and Cycas seemannii leaves were used as high-quality food, whereas C nongnoochiae, Cycas taitungensis, and Cycas condaoensis leaves were used as low-quality food. The daily oviposition rate was not influenced by food quality, but longevity and lifetime fecundity of females were increased by high-quality larval food. These results indicate that in situ Cycas species impose a physiological constraint on the genetic capacity to produce offspring by C pandava. The removal of that constraint by high-quality novel Cycas species may be one reason this butterfly can increase in population rapidly after an invasion event and express greater herbivory of Cycas species within invaded regions.

            Introduction
        </h4>

    <p>The study of life history traits such as life span and fecundity is of fundamental importance for applied ecology and understanding how natural systems function. Moreover, when a plant species becomes endangered due to damage by an invasive phytophagous insect, more knowledge about life history traits of all trophic levels may inform management decisions.

            Chilades pandava (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) is a butterfly that has a wide indigenous range and is characterized by several discrete subpopulations delineated by geography.1 Larval food for this Lycaenid species is young, expanding leaf tissue of Cycas L. (Cycadales: Cycadaceae) species. The extent of herbivory is highly disparate among various Cycas species when the plants are in a common garden

    <li>Image 2 The plant traits that mediate these dynamics are not understood. Availability of quality food during early development of animals may exert a strong influence on longevity, organ function, or fecundity during adult life stages.</li>
